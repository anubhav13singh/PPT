    <h4>What’s Constructor And Its Purpose?</h4>
    <p>The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.</p>

    <h4> Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?</h4>
    <p>This keyword refers to the current object in a function. When a method is called as a property of an object, then this refers to the parent object.</p>

    <h4>What’s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them</h4>
    <p>Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.<br>
        Apply invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.<br>
        Bind returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.
        <pre>
        Apply vs. Call vs. Bind Examples
        Call
        
        var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'};
        var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'};
        
        function say(greeting) {
            console.log(greeting + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
        }
        
        say.call(person1, 'Hello'); // Hello Jon Kuperman
        say.call(person2, 'Hello'); // Hello Kelly King
        Apply
        
        var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'};
        var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'};
        
        function say(greeting) {
            console.log(greeting + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
        }
        
        say.apply(person1, ['Hello']); // Hello Jon Kuperman
        say.apply(person2, ['Hello']); // Hello Kelly King
        Bind
        
        var person1 = {firstName: 'Jon', lastName: 'Kuperman'};
        var person2 = {firstName: 'Kelly', lastName: 'King'};
        
        function say() {
            console.log('Hello ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
        }
        
        var sayHelloJon = say.bind(person1);
        var sayHelloKelly = say.bind(person2);
        
        sayHelloJon(); // Hello Jon Kuperman
        sayHelloKelly(); // Hello Kelly King
    </pre>

        <h4> Explain OOPS ? </h4>
        <p>Object-oriented programming is ultimately about taking a huge problem and breaking it down to solvable chunks.<br>
            OOP can make software development more modular, reusable, and maintainable, which can make it easier to upgrade and update the system</p>

        <h4> Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?</h4>
        <p>Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information</p>
        
        <h4>Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?</h4>
        <p>
            The word “polymorphism” means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics.
            It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects</p>

            <h4>Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?</h4>
            <p>The term 'Inheritance' is derived from the word "Inherit" which means, "to derive any quality, features or characteristics from family". Therefore, "Inheritance is defined as a mechanism where the sub or child class inherits the properties and characteristics of the super class or other derived classes.<br>
                Inheritance helps in code reuse. The child class may use the code defined in the parent class without re-writing it. Inheritance can save time and effort as the main code need not be written again. Inheritance provides a clear model structure which is easy to understand.</p>
        
        <h4> Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?</h4>
        <p>Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object.</p>

        <h4>Explain Class in JavaScript?</h4>
        <p>The class keyword is used to create a class. The properties are assigned in a constructor function.
            In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. </p>

        <h4>What’s Super Keyword & What it does?</h4>
        <p>Super keyword in JavaScript can be used to access and call on an object's parent, it can be used in two ways. Syntax: super(arguments); super. parentMethod(arguments);</p>
